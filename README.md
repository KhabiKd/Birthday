# Birthday.
Birthday - my first app in Play Market.
Birthday is my first app published on the Play Market. Worked on this application all July and published it on July 26, 2021.
Decided to share on github. Here is the link:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kudbi.born.
Initially, I studied Kotlin and did not know Java at all, which is why it is written in Kotlin. 
The essence of the application:
you enter your date of birth, and based on the entered values, the application determines your zodiac sign and offers several screens about your sign.
At that time, I did not know how to transfer values from one Activity to others.
I searched Google for a week and a half, but all this time I typed in the wrong question. Finally, I learned about intent, and things started to go right away.

P.S.
The code does not differ in any beauty, but the main thing is that it works :D
